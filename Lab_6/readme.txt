1. Using TIM4 to produce a PWM signal to control the motor.
2. I found that if set TIM4_CCR2 value to 1230, the pingpong ball will
   go up very slow.
3. Also, I found if set TIM4_CCR2 value to 1160, the pingpong ball will
   go down very slow.
4. IR distance sensor will give me the value between 400 to 2300;
5. User input some value between 400 to 2300, for example 1000.
6. If the sensor IR distance sensor value bigger than 1000, ball go up.
7. If the sensor IR distance sensor value smaller than 1000, ball go down.

** ALL experiment only work well on tube 5 **
